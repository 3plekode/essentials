/**
 * Step-by-step car production
 * In this example, the Builder pattern allows step by step construction of different car models.
 * The example also shows how Builder produces products of different kinds (car manual) using the same building steps.
 * The Director controls the order of the construction. It knows which building steps to call to produce this or that 
 * car model. It works with builders only via their common interface. This allows passing different types of builders 
 * to the director.
 * The end result is retrieved from the builder object because the director canâ€™t know the type of resulting product. 
 * Only the Builder object knows what exactly does it builds.
