# Design Patterns

## Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

![Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/abstract-factory-mini.png) Abstract Factory 
![Builder](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/builder-mini.png) Builder
![Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/prototype-mini.png) Prototype
![Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/singleton-mini.png) Singleton 

## Structural patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

![Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/adapter-mini.png) Adapter 
![Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/bridge-mini.png) Bridge

![Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/decorator-mini.png) Decorator 
![Facade](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/facade-mini.png) Facade
![Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/flyweight-mini.png) Flyweight
![Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/proxy-mini.png) Proxy 

## Behavioral patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

![Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/mediator-mini.png) Mediator
![Memento](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/memento-mini.png) Memento 
![Observer](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/observer-mini.png) Observer
![State](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/state-mini.png) State 
![Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/strategy-mini.png) Strategy
![Template Method](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/template-method-mini.png) Template Method
